Compute statistical power with repeated measurement in the same condition

This package calculated the effective number of participants needed to attain a specified statistical power given the number of time
the measure is replicated and the intermeasurements correlation (intraclass correlation). It uses the formula provided in Goulet &
Cousineau (2019).

It is basically an extension to the excellent package "pwr".

Any comments or suggestions can be sent to Marc-Andr√© Goulet mgoul101@uottawa.ca

Feel free to share the package!
