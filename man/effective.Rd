\usage{
effective(n1 = NULL, corr = NULL, m = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1}{Number of participants if the measurement is only replicated once.}

\item{corr}{Intermeasurement correlation (intraclass correlation)}

\item{m}{Number of times the measurement is replicated.}
}
\description{
This function calculates the effective number of participants in a power analysis. It is
useful for simulations, but also if you have done a power analysis in G*Power and want to calculate the
effective number of participants base on the n1 provided in G*Power.
}
\details{
The function returns the effective number of participants. For more details about this
statistical power adjustment, see Goulet & Cousineau (2019).
