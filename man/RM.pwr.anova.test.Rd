\description{
This function calculates the effective number of participants in a power analysis for a one-way ANOVA
with independant samples after considering the effect of the number of measurement for each dependent
variable and the intra-class correlation of these measurements.
}
\details{
The function returns the effective number of participants to attain the specified
statistical power. You do not need to specify that n is NULL. For more details about this
statistical power adjustment, see Goulet & Cousineau (2019).
