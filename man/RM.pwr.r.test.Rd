\arguments{
\item{r}{Pearson r effect size}

\item{sig.level}{Alpha level}

\item{alternative}{Select one of "two.sided", "greater" or "less"}

\item{corr}{Intra-class correlation between the replicated measurements.}

\description{
This function calculates the effective number of participants in a power analysis for simple
regression after considering the effect of the number of measurement for each dependent variable
and the intra-class correlation of these measurements.
}
\details{
The function returns the effective number of participants to attain the specified
statistical power. You do not need to specify that n is NULL. For more details about this
statistical power adjustment, see Goulet & Cousineau (2019).

\examples{
# Calculating the effective sample size for a simple regression.
# Intra-class correlation is .4 and number of replicated measurements is 8.

 r = .2, # Want to detect a Pearson's correlation of .2
 sig.level = .05,
 power = .95,
 alternative = "two.sided",
 corr = .4,
 m = 8
