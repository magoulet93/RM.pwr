\arguments{
\item{d}{Cohen's d effect size}

\item{sig.level}{Alpha level}

\item{power}{Desired statistical power}

\item{type}{Select one of "one.sample", "two.sample" or "paired"}

\description{
This function calculates the effective number of participants in a power analysis for
t-tests after considering the effect of the number of measurement for each dependent variable and
the intra-class correlation of these measurements.
}
\details{
The function returns the effective number of participants to attain the specified
statistical power. You do not need to specify that n is NULL. For more details about this
statistical power adjustment, see Goulet & Cousineau (2019).
