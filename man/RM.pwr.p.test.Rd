\arguments{
\item{h}{Cohen's h effect size}

\item{sig.level}{Alpha level}

\description{
This function calculates the effective number of participants in a power analysis for one proportion
after considering the effect of the number of measurement for each dependent variable and the intra-
class correlation of these measurements.
}
\details{
The function returns the effective number of participants to attain the specified
statistical power. You do not need to specify that n is NULL. For more details about this
statistical power adjustment, see Goulet & Cousineau (2019).

\examples{
# Calculating the effective sample size required for a one proporition.
# Intra-class correlation is .6 and number of replicated measurements is 5.

 h = .5, # Want to detect a Cohen's h of .5
 sig.level = .01,
 power = .80,
 alternative = "two.sided",
 corr = .6,
 m = 5
