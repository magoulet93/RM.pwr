\description{
This function calculates the effective number of participants in a power analysis for one proportion
after considering the effect of the number of measurement for each dependent variable and the intra-
class correlation of these measurements.
}
\details{
The function returns the effective number of participants to attain the specified
statistical power. You do not need to specify that n is NULL. For more details about this
statistical power adjustment, see Goulet & Cousineau (2019).
